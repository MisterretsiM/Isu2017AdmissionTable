Hi there!

That program will provide more feautures of working with list of entrants that the original one (http://isu.ru/Abitur/ru/rating) (but later. I'm a little lazy)

Unfortunately, the site structure is changing every year, so maybe later that program will not work.

At that moment:
  Sort_Table.py - not in use
  Get_Prof_Table.py - Gets information from http://isu.ru/Abitur/ru/rating about all directions and saves it into xml-like file Isu_Prof_Table.ProfTab
  MainForm.py - Gets all informaition about entrants and displays it on form.
